## Outline
This project is a comprehensive, AI-powered coaching and fitness management platform tailored to meet the needs of professional coaches and their clients. Designed for fitness coaches managing multiple athletes and gym enthusiasts, this platform automates critical daily coaching tasks, ensuring efficiency and a personalized experience for each client.

The system leverages machine learning algorithms and artificial intelligence to provide detailed weekly training programs and calorie burn predictions for exercises. By collecting personalized client information during the account setup, the platform ensures tailored recommendations that optimize athletic performance and fitness progress.

### Key Features
1. **Session Booking System**
   - **Functional Website**: Clients can seamlessly book in-person coaching sessions with the coach.

2. **Personalized Weekly Training Program Generator**
   - **Input Data Collection**: During account creation, the system collects key information such as age, weight, height, fitness level, goals, and activity preferences.
   - **AI-Driven Feature**: Using advanced machine learning algorithms, the platform generates customized, detailed weekly training programs, balancing cardio, strength, flexibility, and sport-specific drills.

3. **Calorie Burn Prediction System**
   - **Advanced Caloric Models**: The system calculates accurate calorie burn estimates for the training sessions and specific exercises generated by the program generator.
   - **Dynamic Updates**: Estimates are personalized using client-specific metrics such as weight, intensity, duration, and type of activity.
